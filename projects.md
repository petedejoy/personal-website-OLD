# Projects

A list of both professional and personal projects that I've worked on

## Professional

### The Airflow Podcast

A semi-regular podcast that I produce focused on the evolution of Apache Airflow as the gold standard for data engineering. I'm responsible for booking interviews, moderating interviews, and all of the audio production and mixing. 

We've had some really awesome guests come on the show, including [Maxime Beauchemin](https://medium.com/@maximebeauchemin), [Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/), and [Bolke de Bruin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bolke/?originalSubdomain=nl).

### Node Billing App

To satisfy my company's need for the ability to collect payment information, I build an app in node.js using the Stripe Elements library that successfully collects credit card information, tokenizes it on an Express server, then makes an API call to Stripe to create a new customer with the card element attributed. It also makes an API call to Mailchimp so that an onboarding drip campaign can be kicked off. I did this with 0 prior experience in javascipt or node, so it was quite the learning experience (shout out to my CTO for being a hero and debugging with late into the evening every night for a month).

## Personal

### Fret_Buzzed

An Instagram account I run with a former bandmate where we post some of the musical projects that we work on in our free time. It's mostly just minute-long covers of various classics, but we have fun with it :).

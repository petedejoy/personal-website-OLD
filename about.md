# About

Hi there! My name's Pete DeJoy and I like startups, tech, skiing, playing guitar, and learning about people who are different from me.

First, a little background on myself: I graduated from Bowdoin College back in May, where I studied Chemistry and Physics while taking as many music and writing courses as my schedule would allow.

I played on the Varisty Football team there, but spent my entire collegiate career battling a back injury and never got a chance to get on the field. Thankfully, I was able to channel some (much less commital) extracurricular energy into the Club Ski Team.

I grew up in suburban New York, I currently live in Cincinnati and work at a tech startup called [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io) through a fellowship program called [Venture for America](https://ventureforamerica.org), and I think more people should spend time in the Midwest.
